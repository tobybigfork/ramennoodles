    <h1>Selling your Home</h1>
    <h2>Areas Covered</h2>
    <p>We advertise in local, regional and national media, together with our own website and the national website portals Rightmove and On The Market. We also keep an active register of people who are looking for property who we notify whenever a suitable property becomes available.</p>
    <p>We offer a professional service to vendors tailored to individual requirements. Property particulars are prepared in-house using quality colour photos and floor plans, for larger properties, or at your discretion, professionally printed colour brochures can be arranged.</p>
    <h2>Our Approach</h2>
    <p>When we are instructed to sell a property, we introduce one of our property negotiators to the house, as we believe it is beneficial that at least two of us in the office have seen the houses that we are selling so that we can give first-hand information to prospective buyers when they ask.</p>
</div>
<div class="column column--right">
<p>We have a good complement of staff across both offices covering all aspects of sales negotiations and administration to ensure that sales run smoothly and we can keep both vendors and buyers informed of the current progress of property sales. We are open from 9am to 5.30 pm Mondays to Fridays and 9am to 4pm on Saturdays.</p>
<p>If you are looking to sell in the area then please do not hesitate to contact us. We are ready to provide you with a professional energetic and honest service. We are proud of the fact that over 90% of our clients recommend our services at <a href="reference">Reference Line.</a></p>
<h2>Our Fees</h2>
<p>At TW Gaze our fees for selling your home are competitive and transparent. If you would like to discuss our fees in further detail please contact our Diss or Wymondham offices.</p>
